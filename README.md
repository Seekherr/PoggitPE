# PoggitPE
A plugin I made for a speedrunning challenge which was set by myself that took around ~40 minutes.
# Usage:
- [X] View information of plugins registered on Poggit.
- [X] Download plugins automatically using just a command.
- [X] An anti-abuse system (not much thought was put into it but it should work well nonetheless).
Some features have not been tested.
# Info
**Will this be updated?**
I don't know. this was just a 'speedrun' plugin meaning it has unoptimized and brain-fart code.<br>
**Will this be on Poggit?**<br>
Unlikely, considering I've heard something like this exists already with more features.<br>
**Can I PR?**<br>
Sure I guess.<br>
