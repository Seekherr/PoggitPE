# PoggitPE
A plugin I made for a speedrunning challenge which was set by myself that took around ~40 minutes.
# Usage:
[x] View information of plugins registered on Poggit.
[x] Download plugins automatically using just a command.
[x] An anti-abuse system (not much thought was put into it but it should work well nonetheless).
# Info
**Will this be updated?**
I don't know. this was just a 'speedrun' plugin meaning it has unoptimized and brain-fart code.
**Will this be on Poggit?**
Unlikely, considering I've heard something like this exists already with more features.
**Can I PR?**
SUre I guess.
